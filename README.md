Quick sketch of analysis choices looking at distribution of microhabitats 
between restored and unrestored reaches of Long Creek.

# Introduction
The Long Creek Watershed, almost three and a half square miles in area, is
dominated by commercial land use. The Maine Mall is one of the largest land
owners in the watershed, and it is surrounded by a range of commercial
businesses, from medical offices, to car washes.  About a third of the watershed
in impervious surfaces like roads, parking lots, and rooftops.

Landowners with an acre or more of impervious area are required to get a Clean
Water Act permit for stormwater discharges from their property.  The LCWMD
provides an alternative for landowners to working to receive an individual
permit. Landowners who elect to participate in the The Long Creek Watershed
Management District receive a General Permit, in return for providing funding to
the District, and facilitating the work of the district by permitting access to
their property for certain activities.

For more information on LCWMD, see [their web site](restorelongcreek.org).

A few years ago, LCWMD undertook an effort to improve habitat quality along a 
portion of Long Creek.  Years of adjacent development activity had restricted 
the floodplain, eroded the stream channel, and removed woody debris and other
roughness elelments from the channel.  In what has probably become the most
ambitious urban stream restoration project in maine history, LCWMD removed
fil lfrom teh floodplain, installed log jabs and other striuctures in the
stream, added gravel and cobbles to the stream, and emplaced downed trees,
rootwads, and wood int ehfloodplain.the most significant urban stream 
restoration offort in Maine.

GZA Geoenvironmental Incorporated (GZA) has been monitoring the effects of
the restoration on stream habitat and the biota. They were kind enough to 
share a version of the 2020 data with me so that I could review and 
independently reprise some of their analyses.
